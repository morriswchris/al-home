Welcome to A Currie Construction! We’re a custom home building company based in Revelstoke, BC, and we’ve been crafting homes with care and quality for years. Owned and operated by Al Currie, who comes from a long line of builders, we take pride in every project we take on.

At A Currie Construction, we focus on doing things right – no shortcuts, just solid craftsmanship. From start to finish, we work closely with you to create a home that fits your vision, needs, and lifestyle. Whether you're building your forever home or a mountain getaway, we’ve got you covered with attention to detail and hands-on care.

We’re a laid-back crew, but when it comes to quality, we’re serious. If you’re looking for a builder who’ll treat your project like their own, we’d love to help bring your dream home to life.
